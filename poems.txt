Angel
-----

You are an angel
sent by God to us.

In the years that
you have been on Earth.

You have won the love
and respect of millions.

May you live for many more years
earning more glory & prosperity.

Friendship
-----

True friendship to keep
is as hard as
saving a flame
on a windy day.

Once trust is broken
it's broken forever
no bandages to put
no medicines can heal.

Just a small mistake
can change your world.
Without a friend
this world is filled with sadness.

It is hard to survive
as hard as it is
for an outcaste
in an orthodox society.

And yet everthing you do
is always breaking someone's trust.

Black & White
-----

The world turns colorless
Everything is so dead and dull
And everyone is waiting
For a miracle to happen

Their lives are filled with guilt
And the blood spots can't be erased
There are only ruins left
To welcome the victory

The cries of mothers
wails of babies
and howls of wives
call those who
went to war.

A few were maimed for life
even fewer returned home
but most went to the grave.

Yet those who returned
wept tears of blood.
The celebration gave only pain
but the rest welcomed the victory.

Mother
-----

It was painful for you
when I was born
it is going to be painful
the day I die.

Despite the pain
you cried out of happiness
when you first saw me.

You sacrificed so much
to give me everything
I ever wished for.

To keep me away
from all that you went through
you readily gave up
all that you loved.

Whenever stubbornly,
I made lavish demands
You forego everything
to meet all of them.

You loved my innocence
and the mischiefs.
For every tear I shed,
you lost thousands.

Like the lioness
that goes without food for days
you feed and nurture us
without the full meal you need.

When I can't keep up with
the dreams you have for me.
I feel like a criminal
that begs for forgiveness.
